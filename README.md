# Credit-Score-Classification

Importance of a Credit Score Classifier :- 
•	Credit score classification using machine learning allows for more accurate predictions of creditworthiness, which can help lenders make better lending decisions.
•	Machine learning algorithms can analyse a wider range of data points than traditional credit scoring methods, which can lead to a more comprehensive assessment of an           individual's creditworthiness.
•	Credit score classification using machine learning can help reduce bias in credit scoring, as algorithms can be designed to focus only on relevant data points, rather than     subjective factors such as race, gender, or age.

Steps to implement the project :- 
•	The aim of this machine-learning model is the identification of statistically reliable relationships between input data features and the target variable.
•	Two algorithms in use will be-
  1.	Pre-processing of dataset.
  2.	Proposed credit system algorithm.
•	Data processing will be done of the credited dataset consisting of structured and unstructured dataset.
•	Then using Feature Selection (FS), a Model will be created.
•	Then the model will be trained after going through the Random Forest Classifier.
